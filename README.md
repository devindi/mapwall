Android application to create wallpaper from map. Inspired by [Background Generator by Alvar Carto](https://alvarcarto.com/phone-background/). Application based on OpenStreetMap so any tile-based map source may be used to create wallpaper. Currently Mapwall works with some styles from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/), [Thunderforest](https://www.thunderforest.com/), [Stamen](http://maps.stamen.com/)

2. Clone this GitHub repository.
3. In Android Studio open the project from the local repository as a **Gradle project** (this will auto-generate `local.properties` with the SDK location).
